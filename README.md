## Maryam's Frontend Practice

My project as a part of the [Frontend Practice](https://www.frontendpractice.com/) challenge created by [Kyle Shook](https://www.kyleshook.com/). The goal of this project is to practice, improve and gain frontend skills by recreating real websites.

All websites were built using HTML, CSS, Less and JavaScript.
